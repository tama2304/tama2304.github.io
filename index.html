    My name is Theodore Amanatidis. I am a senior at Thomas A. Edison High School in Jamaica, New York. 
    I have good coding skills in HTML and CSS, and I am learning JavaScript and Python this year. 
    I've always had an interest in technology and I want to become a Computer Programmer in the future.
