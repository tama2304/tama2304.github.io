    My name is Theodore Amanatidis. I am a senior at Thomas A. Edison High School in Jamaica, New York.<br> 
    I have good coding skills in HTML and CSS, and I am learning JavaScript and Python this year.<br> 
    I've always had an interest in technology and I want to become a Computer Programmer in the future.

    <h2>Random Quote Generator</h2>
    <p>For this project, we used HTML and JavaScript to randomly generate a quote from a set of seven.<br>
    JavaScript picks one of these quotes from the array using a Math.random method inside of the click function of the button.<br>
    I also used CSS to style the page with different fonts and colors to make it look more visually appealing.

    <h2>Photo Gallery Project</h2>
    <p>For this project, we had to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a photo gallery with a theme of our choice.<br>
    We needed to add three images from the start, and then use JavaScript to make it so you can add more images using inputs and a click function.<br>
    For my photo gallery, I chose a theme of video game consoles and put the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 5, and Xbox Series X as the first three images.<br>  
    I also added captions underneath all the images and used CSS to make the images the same size, as well as to add some appealing colors and fonts to the page.
